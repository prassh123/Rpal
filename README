1. Rpal installation directory is already included as part of this jar.
2. Go to the Rpal directory and issue a "make"
3. cd to one directory above (the base dir of the project)
4. make cl - to remove all the class files
5. make all - to compile the java files. The results get placed under the directory "parser"
6. make run OPT=-ast TESTFILE=<Path to the rpal test file> to get the abstract syntax tree.
   Example: make run OPT=-ast TESTFILE=rpal/tests/add
7. make test - to invoke and run the tests.

There is a shell file "p1" that is included in case if you need to run an individual rpal test file.
Syntax:
./p1 -ast <path to rpal file>
Example: ./p1 -ast rpal/tests/add
./p1 -l  - Lists the options available
./p1 - produces no output.
